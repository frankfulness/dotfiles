# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

# Pack folder
If lazy is giving you issues, you can symlink the plugins in `path` to somewhere in the pack path. Really irritating, but I can't find another way to use lazynvim unthemed.
